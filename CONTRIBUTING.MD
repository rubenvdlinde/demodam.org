## Spread the word!
Feel free to blog, tweet, post about Demodam whenever you like! We're in this together. There's always stuff to do. Check out the [Communications board](https://github.com/demodam/demodam.org/projects/1) to see if there's anything you can help out with. Or add to it if you have a good idea.  

## Publish Common Ground components to Demodam
Demodam is a showcase website for open source components. Please read the [organisation page](/Organizations.md) for the rules and apllication procces or reach out to the Technical action team via Slack or Github if you need support.

## Take part in an action team

The Demodam codebase forms action teams to solve specific tasks. Each team has a team lead that is responsible for setting dates for meetings of the team and for (collaboratively) setting the agenda. The team lead is also a first point of contact for the team. 

These teams can make day to day decisions to move things forward, but cannot overrule decisions made by the steering team. Each action team must be represented in the steering group by at least one person (as a linking pin). Usually that person is the team lead. If a team cannot resolve an issue with consensus in the group, any participant of the group can raise the issue to the steering team. Action teams have the mandate to take action whenever they think it helps Demodam and work on an "ask for forgiveness, not for permission" basis for now. So be bold! And have fun ðŸ¦–. 

### Communications action team
Open group that works in a community style (there is likely to be a core team, that guides a wider community of participants and ambassadors). See the [Communications Project Board](https://github.com/demodam/demodam.org/projects/1) for the current activities (and please take part!).

* Social media, promotions, coverage, etc.
* **Members**: Alba Roza (team lead), Edo Plantinga, Caroline?, Harrie Kuipers?, Ruud de Vries?

### Technical action team

* Hosting setup
* How can several competing products all get a place on Demodam? (technical aspects of that)
* Advise (not decide) on acceptance criteria of components from a technical point of view (ie definition of done)
* **Members**: Ruben van der Linden (team lead), Joeri

### User centricity action team

* Advise (not decide) on acceptance criteria from a  user centered design point of view (ie definition of done)
* Organize workshops before and during hackathons
* Advise on the design of demodam.nl itself (how are the needs of different stakeholders met?). Guide the user centered design process to achieve this.
